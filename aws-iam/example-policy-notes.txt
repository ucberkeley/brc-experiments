Some words of wisdom:

1) need to allow CreateTags as EC2 console tries to add a 'Name' tag. For some reason, it only complains about not being able to apply the tag if there is _also_ a stanza pertaining to terminating instances. EC2 documentation says allowing CreateTags is a bad idea because it allows users to change tags and get around tag-level limits, but at this stage I have other fish to fry. 

2) The use of a specific security group will prevent having a class of students with each creating their own security group for every instance launch and hitting EC2's limit on security groups in an account.

3) I needed an explicit statement allowing Terminate,Stop,Start instances to be able to modify running instances. But per #1, once I added this, I needed the CreateTags.  

4) To decipher the encoded failure messages you may get when playing with policies, do this (replacing the particular message with whatever you get); you'll need the AWS CLI tools.
aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message 7OmYs9xwSdM6ymyKLBMwfhJhVPrY7wa2JWEpkux2KX5mxXHvt3uTGrcdxwql2k11OkM9pN9yqtkGdJPMC4xL40VQV0c1Y-pKYm_OaKIweCc_aKGmxLKJDlEDWXQ2AL4x-b0ByOLazeQwn9QYgADuOGBfNNJjr17gTJ_r6-7OpJChRN_GI9JYwxidi5lWKzEiscz6r48KVvksso8-lF8rYb-atIsp9CojLKhJyL3bwp_N_Vncyp_vJmSBp6gArDraiy51-8zkS0yje3tu4KXO9UJGBr2wja2nxS9oYeomC87w6mYGSDH5ak7CqP8kgAjDW8P40j8vHJhqgxddAVDJ0l04q2loYWGdEkxwqyAzw7sAVn0T3x-6zMVWEBv3y0_LaH_1S7NqhaAZb7p9wXSXuxDuPGkzyTHAcXVDih8NVuthd8pc43jLhNkp0KRhFOBp6zhPZVIXOU5Kj1IfrYe5dCp5SvoSPmdX-3Vst0m1qGiPGgp5ymkH7prTsvybaQLheClRoQMU00JiCg
